# Pipeline 3
Pipeline 3 is a puzzle game about moving fluids into the goal pipe. You can select from a ever growing palette of tiles to interact with the simulation and get the fluids or objects where you want them to be. By pressing alt while placing or by double clicking on an existing tile, you can switch it to its alternative form (IE: Normal Tiles become acid vulnerable in their alternate form). Each tile and fluid is subject to a temperature simulation and will exchange temperatures on contact. If fluids reach certain temperatures, they can freeze or vaporize.
__Complete Tile List:__
___
- Default Tile, a simple square that prevents fluids and objects from passing through
- Cracked Tile, will permanently disappear when in contact with acid.

__Game Details__
There is 100 levels in total, with the 100th being a large gauntlet type level with 7 parts. Every 11 levels is a "Boss Level" meaning it has a much higher difficulty compared to the previous levels. After the boss level, a new background will be introduced. Backgrounds unlocked in play mode will be unlocked in doodle mode, and after the clearing of the 100th level, more tiles will be unlocked as well. Level codes can be output in Doodle mode and pasted into other instances of the game in any computer. Users can share levels among each other by sending Level Codes to enter in game.
